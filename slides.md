## Lifting Weights

Three common sports you'll hear:

+ (Olympic) Weightlifting
+ Powerlifting
+ Strongman (there's Strongwoman too, but Strongman is unfortunately the most
  well known name, no Stronghuman)

## How do they differ?

+ Movement
+ Equipment
+ (Body) Weight classes

## Weightlifting

+ Miffed about the genericization of "weightlifting"
+ Specific prescribed movements starting from the ground
    * Clean and jerk
    * Snatch
    * Clean and press (formerly)
+ Winner determined by weight lifted
+ Best of 3 attempts, attempt can be disqualified if form is bad
+ All use barbell + weight plates
+ Should probably be called powerlifting since it involves explosive movements
  requiring a lot of power

## Weightliting weird (or lesser known) things

+ Little direct focus on upper body so often physique does not look "stereotypical"

## Powerlifting

+ Specific prescribed movements (abbreviated as SBD)
    * Squat
    * Bench press
    * Deadlift
+ Winner determined by weight lifted
+ Best of 3 attempts, attempt can be disqualified if form is bad
+ All use barbell + weight plates
+ Should probably be called weightlifting since they are generally slow
  movements focusing exclusively on weight lifted

## Powerlifting (weird things)

+ Sometimes the form gets weird


## Strongman

+ Circus origins
+ Every competition has different movements
+ Each movement has different scoring criteria
    * Sometimes weight
    * Sometimes time (shortest or longest)
    * Sometimes repetitions
+ Movements are often specifically calculated to be "flashy"
+ Should probably be called "strength potpourri"

## Strongman (stones)

+ Lifting rocks!

## Strongman (cars)

+ Lifting cars!
+ Pulling trains!

## Strongman (random things)

+ Making a big wheel move!

## Strongman (weird things)

+ Sometimes part of the spectacle is the contestants!
+ E.g. this guy, whose nose basically explodes every time he deadlifts.

## Other strength sports I haven't talked about

+ Basque stone lifting
